Final Project for Blockchain Technologies by Andrew Hogan, James Moy, and Jonathan (J) Tarness

# **Introduction**
  While there are many auction apps/sites such as Ebay, Facebook marketplace, and Amazon marketplace, they all share the commonality of being centralized services. This prevents auctioneers and bidders from enjoying true privacy while browsing new items to bid on. These large companies are able to gather unnecessary data about each user such as the types of items they normally bid and the average amount they bid per item. A decentralized auction app like FreeTrade will protect the privacy of all parties involved as they conduct business.  
  FreeTrade is an auction app that allows user to place any item they wish on the site for sale among other users. The app utilizes blockchain technologies to establish a decentralized service that is able to keep track of all transactions. Each item placed for auction and subsequent transaction mines a new block in the chain, and users are able to easily keep track of recent activity on the app. 
## **Features**
- Selecting an Item for Auction-
Users should be able to select a desired item and place it up for auction at a starting transaction price. Information needed: name/type of item, description, starting price 
- Placing a Bid on an Item-
Upon searching for an item or browsing the market homepage, the user will have the ability to    place a bid on their desired item. By specifying gas price and the max ETH a user is willing to give up, an itemâ€™s current bid total will be adjusted. 
- Finalizing a Transaction-
After a period of time passes or a specific amount of funds are received through bids, the item will be sold to the last highest bidder. The user will be sent a receipt for the transaction reflecting the ETH lost in the purchase as well as the information of the item purchased. 
- Viewing Previous Transactions-
Users should be able to view the previous transactions/bids from their account by tracking the transaction receipts while the app is launched
